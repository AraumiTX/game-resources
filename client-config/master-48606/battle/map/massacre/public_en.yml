      The battlefront is located on the territory of the state formerly
      known as the state of Oregon. Meteor strikes have turned these 
      once picturesque hills into a terrain unsuitable for life, 
      and the deposits of crystals that were discovered after the bombing,
      have turned this area into a war zone.
