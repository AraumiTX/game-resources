      After the city was abandoned, a lonely meteorologist decided 
      to settled in one of the houses. Luckily, years later, 
      his laboratory was discovered by a group of scouts 
      who were roaming the area in search for deposits of crystals.
      The “Temperature block” and the “Ice trap” modules were later developed
      based on the work of the hermit scientist.
