    Old School is a historic place. The legendary physicist Ilya Loginov studied and then taught here in the early XXI. And later in 2045, he created a first prototype of the tank "X". Of course, his native village with the school was destroyed during the years of cataclysms and years of war between corporations. But the descendant of the scientist once recreated it as one of the training grounds for fighters. However, sometimes it fails to simulate the supplies landing.
