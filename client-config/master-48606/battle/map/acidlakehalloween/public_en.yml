      Someone once said, "A battlefield that has seen too much blood, can never be the same it was before". Yes, this place feels macabre. It has long given up on fighting its horrific memories and totally emerged into madness. You can hear soldiers screaming and shots of their tanks echoing in the distance as if it wants you to relive the madness of those events. The place hasn't seen smoke or powder in years, yet, these are strongly felt in the air and the thick green mist looks like it wants to suffocate everything in its path. This place has definitely gone mad.
      You should not be here. Nobody should ever visit this place ever again.
