      Rio is the home of the Frontier - a union of companies
      that arbitrarily separated themselves from Antaeus, in an attempt to stop
      the dictatorship of the corporation and restore the free market. 
      It is also where Frontier built their headquarters.

      As a result of the confrontation between Antaeus and Frontier, 
      the blossoming tourist mecca has become a war zone. 
      The population of Rio was evacuated, and the areas surrounding the city were mined.
