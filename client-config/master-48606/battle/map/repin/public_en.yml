      Tank carriers are transportation ships and they are not designed for military operations.
      The strategy that Frontier used during their attack relied heavily on the use of jump pads.
      These are gravitational platforms designed to transport cargo and tanks aboard the ship,
      much faster.

      The first attempt to take over the “Repin” tank carrier went down in history,
      despite the fact that the attacking side, the Frontier, suffered a horrendous loss.
      But with this act, the forces of the resistance have shown that they are ready 
      to sacrifice everything, just to see the corporation overthrown!
