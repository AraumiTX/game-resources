  name: RGK-03 «Thor»
  description: After evaluating the effectiveness of the electromagnetic ammunition EM-PС MkII for Shaft in battles with the "Frontier", the scientists of Antaeus corporation decided to implement a similar idea in the «Thor» for the Hammer. The usual shrapnel in the ammunition was replaced by special capsules, which caused a weak electro-magnetic pulse when detonated, and the total impulse of several capsules caused the shutdown of all electronics of the «X» tanks. But «Thor» was powerless against hulls with modified EM-protection and eventually remained available only to collectors.
