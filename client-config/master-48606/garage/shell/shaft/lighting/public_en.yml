  name: EM-PC MkII «Lighting»
  description: "In the early stages of war, when the tanks still had poorly protected electronics, Frontier scientists decided to pass through the Shaft ammunition's plasma a strong electrical discharge, so the turret received electromagnetic properties and could briefly turn off enemy tanks. Unfortunately, this ammunition was effective not a long time, because «X» tanks began to be produced with the protection of electronics. But lovers of unusual visual effects use it until this time."
