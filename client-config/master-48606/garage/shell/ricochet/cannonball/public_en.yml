  name: RCX-42 «Cannonball»
  description: "The experimental ammunition RCX-42 could only be used when replacing the gun barrel with a high-alloy steel barrel. When the ammunition flies out of the turret, the ball becomes unstable and collapses to a solid state with a large mass, creating a flash and smoke, as when fired from a gun with gunpowder. The ammunition is not allowed to mass production due to the heavy wear of the gun turret and the high production costs."
