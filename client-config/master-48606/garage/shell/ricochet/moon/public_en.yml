  name: RC-01A «Moon»

    |
    The RK-01A ammunition — codenamed "Moon" — was used by the Frontier corporation as an aim-assistance device for the "Ricochet" turret. When fired, RK-01A projectiles leave a trail that makes it easier to assess the behavior of the "Ricochet" shots and adjust accordingly. 
    For a long time, the RK-01A was considered lost. But some mercenaries recently stumbled upon an abandoned Frontier outpost with a warehouse containing a full cache of RK-01A. Within a few days, the ammunition was already being circulated on the black market.
