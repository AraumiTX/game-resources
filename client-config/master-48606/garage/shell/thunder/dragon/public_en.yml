    The HEI/T-15 ammunition was nicknamed "Dragon" for a reason. This ammunition is treated with a special type of gunpowder that causes the flame to act as a smokescreen, reducing the enemy's visibility. 
    Additionally, the explosive is mixed with a highly combustible solution that sets fire to the air wherever it spreads, keeping it burning for a brief time. However, the temperature of these flames is too low to actually heat up an enemy tank.
