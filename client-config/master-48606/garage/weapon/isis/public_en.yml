  name: Isida
  description: "Isida mobile repair units have been used to repair worn-out equipment working in the crystal deposits under extreme conditions. These units take advantage of the restorative properties of crystals, which can be used to make repairs to equipment after they receive damage. The first battle for the crystal processing facilities showed that Isida units are not only able to successfully recover mining equipment, but they can also be used to strip armor from tanks when correctly configured."
