  name: Shaft
  description: 'The Shaft is a very accurate weapon created by Frontier for waging positional battles over the mountain passes of Latin America. Its sniper mode, the increased damage to turrets, and the ability to conduct effective short-range battles have made Shaft the hope for a clean victory. That was until Antaeus engineers replicated the turret by studying a partially destroyed weapon they found on a partially destroyed tank.'
