  description: "The Twins turret was one of the first guns of the future produced by Antaeus. It was created using the crystals that fell to earth in meteor showers. The double-barrel plasma cannon is a tactical battlefield weapon that is perfect for suppressing enemy fire. Do not let the enemy find their bearings and aim during a heavy bombardment. This is an indispensable weapon for Blitzkrieg warfare."
