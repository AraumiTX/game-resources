  name: Thunder
  description: 'The Thunder turret was invented to eliminate the tank armies of the most modern Asian states, when Antaeus was ready to announce that it had completely taken over the world. "X" Tanks underwent a baptism of fire at a time when there were still far fewer of them than the previous generation of tanks. Under these conditions, the Thunder turret provided some assurance that the new tanks would be able to survive. The Thunder turret can be used to strike a group of enemies at once using explosive shells. The quick recharge rate ensures that you will achieve a quick and decisive victory.'
