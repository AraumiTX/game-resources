  name: Vulcan
  description: "The accurate and fast-firing Vulcan turret was Frontier's first line of defense during its first battles. Its stabilizers work perfectly when you are taking counter fire from the enemy. It is just the weapon for medium range fire when waging high-speed, Blitzkrieg warfare. It is imperative, however, to avoid overheating so that you do not damage your hull."
