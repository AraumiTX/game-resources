  name: Ricochet
  description: "The latest development of the red corporation, Ricochet, became the answer to the Twins. Trapped inside a magnetic field, the balls of plasma are able to bounce off obstacles. The weapon's sensors accurately determine when they come in contact with the plating of an enemy tank, and only then do they release their payload. When your enemy can no longer hide from projectile fire in confined urban spaces behind bends in the road or in tunnels, the chance that they will escape is much reduced."
