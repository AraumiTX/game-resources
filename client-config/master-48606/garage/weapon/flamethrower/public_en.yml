  name: Firebird
  description: "The Firebird is the key to urban warfare. It proved its effectiveness when Antaeus subdued the islands and metropolitan areas of the Pacific. This turret knows its stuff: set fire to your enemy's tank, and then move on. The burning napalm will devour enemy equipment without need for any outside support. Heavy tanks will have no chance. Does it seem like the weapon is taking too long to recharge? You can still shoot burning napalm at the enemy even from half-filled fuel tanks."
