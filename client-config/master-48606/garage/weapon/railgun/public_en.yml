  name: Railgun
  description: 'A kinetic weapon and the "X" Tank are the ideal combination for waging battle in circumstances where any other weapon could fail. Huge open spaces proved to be excellent testing grounds for honing the performance properties of the Railgun. It is able to cut through several enemy tanks at once before they are even in range to offer counter fire.'
