  name: Hunter
  description: 'The Hunter is the gold standard for all "X" Tanks. This was the first hull to go into mass production. It is widely used to this day. This is the first generation tank shell. It represents an attempt to reach an effective compromise between armor and maneuverability. The Hunter is good for when you need to fight and do not need to return fire.'
