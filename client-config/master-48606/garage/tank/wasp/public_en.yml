  name: Wasp
  description: "This hull was specifically designed to cater to the needs of private armies around the world. The Wasp makes short work of old-style tanks, and it is also a valuable tool to fighting modern wars. It can quickly cover distances, and it is easily able to escape enemy fire. It is designed to intercept and engage a cornered enemy in a Blitzkrieg-style battle. This hull poorly resists blows and can even flip over when hit by heavy shells. But it will faithfully serve those that can avoid enemy fire."
