  name: Hornet
  description: "It was developed by Antaeus to effectively promote their \"X\" Tanks on battlefields around the world. Hornets can appear right in front of the enemy's nose at lightning speed and smash their position. This hull can withstand direct hits and still stay on track, but it is not good for performing quick maneuvers on a dime."
